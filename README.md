# Scheduling App

This project was built using `React` + `Vite` + `Typescript` + `Tailwindcss` in the front end and `Ruby on Rails` in API mode as the backend.

# Setup and Initialization

```
$ scheduling-app  ~ docker-compose up
$ scheduling-app ~ cd backend
$ backend        ~ rails db:create && rails db:migrate && rails db:seed
```

And that is all ðŸ˜Š
